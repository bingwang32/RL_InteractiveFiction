Final Project Check-in  (Points)

- Name(s): Bing Wang
- Finalized Research Question (1): How do I train a reinforcement learning agent to 
- The following working code in GitHub (3): See RL_Final_Project.ipynb
    - A environment (1): Imported from: https://github.com/microsoft/jericho
    - An agent that performs random actions in the environment (1)
    - An agent that learns based on the environment (1)
- List of ideas to finish project (1): 
    - Possibly try with both choosing action from available actions, and sampling from full vocabulary (e.g. building action from cardinal directions or verb/noun). 
    - Or, sample from available actions, but consider the content of the text (e.g. does it appear in the state (text associated with step))
    - Have a fair amount still to do on establishing learning RL agents:
