# Navigating Interactive Fiction with Reinforcement Learning
I trained a reinforcement learning agent to learn how to navigate an interactive fiction game through Q-learning.

Please see my detailed report [here](https://github.com/bingwang32/RL_InteractiveFiction/blob/master/Navigating_Interactive_Fiction_with_Reinforcement_Learning.ipynb) and my video presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJkoLr46280).
